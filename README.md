Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant application that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my application will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. 

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. And user is able to delete devoured burger. And also application stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

 This application is burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). I followed the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML.
